# shablockchain
This is a tool that is used to analyze the various SHA algorithms used in blockchain technology
I utilized Tkinter to allow for a Graphical User Interface

## Important:
Do not run this program and click on the button "Save Running Times" until you have completed clicking "Submit" for each run case
If you want to run new tests be sure to exit the program and start fresh.
The "Refresh All Data" button will erase all lists data to plot again from scratch. Use this button wisely.
There is limited error handling in this code and still is being fixed annually

## Description for each file are as follows:

SHA3Blockchainv5.py --> used for allowing the analysis of the SHA algorithm

setup.py --> used for allowing the user to easily install necessary libraries, note-some commands might not work necessarily and is consistently being updated
